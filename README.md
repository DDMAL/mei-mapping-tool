## Mongodb installation

Depending on your OS, you should follow the instructions to install and run MongoDB as a service upon start.

To install it in Ubuntu 18.04 follow [these instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)
  
If the installation was fine, when opening the terminal window and typing
 
`mongo`
  
you should be able to interact with the database with mongodb commands like `show dbs`to show a list of all the databases. A list of useful commands can be found in this link : https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongo-shell/
 
 ### With the MongoDB Compass Community object
 1. Open the MongoDB compass community application and connect to the `localhost:27017`.
 2. Open the Collections tab of the mei-mapping-tool database to see the information from the collections.
