# Cress ðŸŽµ
Web-based app to map squiggles to MEI snippets (under construction)

You can access the public version of the mei-mapping-tool app at https://cress.simssa.ca
You can access the development version of the mei-mapping-tool app at https://cress-staging.simssa.ca

## Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) *for mac users*
* [Mongodb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) Make sure MongoDB is installed (`brew install mongodb`)
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/) `npm install mongoose`
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm):
 `npm install npm@latest -g`

 To check if you have npm or node.js, you can run these commands in your terminal :

  `npm -v`

  `node -v`

## Setup

1. Clone this repository in your terminal from the `develop` branch

  `git clone https://github.com/DDMAL/mei-mapping-tool`

2. Go to the mei-mapping-tool repository

  `cd mei-mapping-tool`

3. Install dependencies using npm

  `npm install`

4. Start the server

  `npm run dev_start`

  You should be able to see the message *node ./bin/www*

If you are seeing errors, such as `TypeError: require(...) is not a function` in regard to `var MongoStore = require('connect-mongo')(session);`, package.json dependencies may have been updated to incompatible versions. Delete `package-lock.json`, revert to the original package.json from this repo, and run `npm install` again.

You can work on the developement version of the mei-mapping-tool by accessing the page http://localhost:8800/

## Mongodb installation

Depending on your OS, you should follow the instructions to install and run MongoDB as a service upon start.

To install it in Ubuntu 18.04 follow [these instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)

If the installation was fine, when opening the terminal window and typing

`mongo`

you should be able to interact with the database with mongodb commands like `show dbs`to show a list of all the databases. A list of useful commands can be found in this link : https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongo-shell/

 ### With the MongoDB Compass Community object
 1. Open the MongoDB compass community application and connect to the `localhost:27017`.
 2. Open the Collections tab of the mei-mapping-tool database to see the information from the collections.

For more information about how the application works, you can go to the Cress [wiki](https://github.com/DDMAL/mei-mapping-tool/wiki).

## Server Information

IP addresses for the server can be found through the lab's Arbutus account with Compute Canada. You need to create an SSH key pair and talk to Alex or NÃ©stor about the local SSH configuration for tunneling (proxy jumping) through a lab computer into the Compute Canada virtual machines. You will only share the PUBLIC KEY (**<key_name>.pub** not **<key_name>**) with the individual assisting you. 

Your local SSH configuration should look something like this after sending your sending your public key and it's configuration

```
Host ddmal_<ddmal_member_name>
  HostName <ip_addr>
  User <name> # username provided to you
  IdentityFile ~/cressdev #just a suggested key pair name, put the system path here that leads to it on your local device

# Production #####################
